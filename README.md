# Memory Game

A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. There are so many versions of it it is hard to in down it's exact origin. There are claims that the famuos writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain invented his own version. I googled it and whatever it is, it looks more like a way of trying to figure out how much tax you owe rather than match cards.

In this repo you will find the code for the game and a link where you can see/play the game in real-time.

The styling is basic the main foucs in on the coding part and to make the game. You can style it as you wish, and can also add new features in it.

### ðŸŽ° Rules of Game
- You will start by flipping over one card.
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop-up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score.
- These cards then disspear.
- If the mext card you flip does not match, a pop-up alert notifies you of that your cards do not match and you have to play again, and the cards flip back.
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
